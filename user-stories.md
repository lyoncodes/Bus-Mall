// Marketing Research
1)
    As a Marketing Research Team I want to see what products attract the buyer's attention, so that we can put those products in the catalog. 
2)
    As a Marketing Reserach Team I want the sample products to be displayed in the same format as the catalog, so that we aren't blindsided by a formatting issue as we go to press. 
3)
    As a Marketing Research Team I want to know about WHO the user is. So a brief survey asking questions about the user would be valuable,so that we can understand more about the person making the choice. 
4) 
    As a Marketing Research Team I want to save costs by reducing the amount of time the research group spends making their selections. So I want the website to have a timer, requiring a decision in 15 seconds or less.

// The Developer 
1)
    As a Developer I want to finish a project successfully, so that I don't feel like a complete failure in life. 
2)
    As a Developr I want to finish a project successfully, so that I can have some confidence that something in my life will go right. 
3)
    As a Developer I want to have a seamless webpage so that I can also work on styling the catalog and contract work to encompass a digital version of BusMall.
4)
    As a Developer I want to create a webpage that draws an authentic user reaction so that the product testing is as accurate as possible. 

// The Foucs Group
1)
    As a Focus Group Member, I want to get paid, so that I can pay rent and continue living in Seattle.
2)
    As a Focus Group Member, I want to save time, and ideally get paid the full amount for spending less time in the focus group.
3)
    As a Focus Group Member, I want the module to be very easy, so that I don't have to work too hard on thinking about anything other than the products. 
4)
    As a Focus Group Member, I want instructions for usage to be equitable and encompassing of diversity. I don't want to see elevated language or lofty terms--so that I don't feel like the module is aimed at someone else. If the focus group feels that way, they are way more likely to just 'click-through'.
